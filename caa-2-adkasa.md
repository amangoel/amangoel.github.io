## Analysis of CAA and NRC - Part 2

In my [first essay](./caa-1) in this series, I posited that there are two major tests that every law needs to continually pass. The first test is whether the reasons for making a certain law are still sound. The second is whether the net impact of a law is still positive.

In this essay, I will test CAA on these two questions. Let's look at the soundness of the reasons behind CAA first. CAA gives citizenship to all Hindus, Sikhs, and members of 4 other religions who are citizens of either Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Afghanistan and have been living illegally in India before 31st Dec, 2014. It also shortens the minimum time from 11 years to 6 years that a person, who fits the above criteria, except the date test, has to have lived in India to be granted citizenship.
