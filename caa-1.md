## Analysis of CAA and NRC - Part 1


In this series of essays, I want to examine the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) that have been topics of much debate in India recently. My goal is to evaluate all opinions on the basis of logic till, with each line of reasoning, I reach a point where it is then left to one's beliefs to proceed further. I do not intend to question the beliefs.

In my initial essays, I will examine CAA only. In the subsequent string of essays I will examine the NRC and then finally I will study the connection between the two. In this essay, I will examine a fundamental question that is independent of the specifics of CAA, but which needs to be answered to allow a sound evaluation of CAA nonetheless. That question is - **How do we evaluate a law?**

In a democracy, a proposed law is discussed in a representative forum, which is called a Parliament, an Assembly, a Congress, etc. After deliberations, and amendments, if a majority of the members of that representative forum support the proposal, it becomes a law and is applied to the constituents. The debates are generally recorded in some form for posterity. I posit here that there are two major axes along which every proposed law is evaluated during these discussions. The first is the justification behind the proposal and the second is the potential impact of the law on its constituents. Once the proposal is accepted and applied in the form of a law, the same two tests continue to be applied to the law until it fails one or both of them. It is then that the law is reconsidered. Therefore, the two major ways to evaluate a law are - 1) are the reasons behind the law being made still sound?, and 2) is the impact of the law on the land overall good?

In the next part of this series of essays, I will apply the same two tests to CAA and see how it fairs.
